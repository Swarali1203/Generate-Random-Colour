# Generate-Random-Colour
A simple and interactive web project that generates a random color on button click. It displays both the color preview and its corresponding hex code, making it a fun and educational tool for developers, designers, or anyone curious about colors.
 How It Works :-
A button triggers a JavaScript function.
The function: 
Generates a random number between 0 and 16777215 (the range of 6-digit hexadecimal colors).
Converts that number to a hex color code (e.g., #A1B2C3).
The generated color is applied as the background color of a preview box.
The hex code is also displayed for reference.
